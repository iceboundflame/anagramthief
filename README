This is the code for [Anagram Thief](http://dcliu.com/projects/anagram-thief/), which is a real-time multiplayer word game in which you race to build words from letter tiles, and you can steal your opponentsâ€™ words by rearranging and adding letters.

Note: The site is no longer live and the code is unmaintained. Provided for posterity in case anyone is interested in doing something with it.
