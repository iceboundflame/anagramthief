%h2 What is Anagram Thief?
%p
  Anagram Thief is a real-time, web-based version of a board game called
  %strong "Snatch-word" or "Anagrams."

%p
  You start with a pool of letter tiles, all face down.
  As you and your opponents reveal them one at a time, it's a
  %strong race to take any words that appear.
%p
  %strong Steal existing words
  by rearranging the letters and extending the word! For example, if your friend had the word
  = succeed "," do
    %strong LOG
  and an
  %strong A
  appeared in the letter pool, you could make
  = succeed "." do
    %strong GOAL
%p Most intense when you have at least three players! No limit to the number of players, but it'll get really challenging in a big room. You can also practice on your own.
